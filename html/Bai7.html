                A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is 
                belived it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles
                include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the 
                eyes, an action know as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed 
                without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
